This is a fantasy football website project that I worked on in the Fall 2022 semester. 
The website is built using React, Javascript, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
It contains many various features:
- Adding/removing/editing teams
- Protected Routes
- User Authentication
- Live Chat
- and much more!

Here are some screenshots of the project:
